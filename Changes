	* lib/Algorithm/Evolutionary.pm (import): 0.69_1 fixed some
	problems with missing prerrequisites in the test programs, and
	some copy/paste stuff left from creating new modules. 0.70 starts
	with the intention of finally having a GUI.

2009-07-24    <jmerelo@localhost.localdomain>

	* lib/Algorithm/Evolutionary.pm: 0.68 was shortlived, but 0.69
	more or less the same. 0.69 included missing file and fixed some
	docs errors; 0.69_1 starts with the same objective, let's see how
	it ends.

2009-07-24  Juan Julian Merelo Guervos  <jmerelo@geneura.ugr.es>

	* TODO: 0.68 ends with several new test functions added (Trap,
	ECC), and finally a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm, not
	very good, but in working order.

2009-03-29    <jmerelo@localhost.localdomain>

	* lib/Algorithm/Evolutionary.pm: 0.68 starts with the usual
	cosmetic changes to the documentation.  

	* Added "rough consensus" utility as well as a "convergence
	terminator", which checks whether a part of the population has
	converged. Upgraded to 0.67. Already!

2009-02-21  jmerelo  <jmerelo@localhost.localdomain>

	* lib/Algorithm/Evolutionary.pm (import): Changing to 0.64_2 to
	eventually fix  the 0500-generation-skel.t, which was not written
	correctly. Also fixed some doc problems.
