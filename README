Algorithm/Evolutionary version 0.01
===================================

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

WARNING

Since evolutionary algorithms are stochastic optimization algorithms,
some of them, specially in the general.t test, might fail; running
them again might yield a different result. If your installation (from
CPAN or CPANPLUS) fails for this reason, run a force install, or try
to make install.
