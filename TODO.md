TODO
====

Admin TODO
---

* [ ] Divide this repo into different ones with data on one place (or on many), trunk stuff in another and examples in yet another

Refactoring todo
---
* [ ] Deprecate XML support. It's useless and it only creates problems in
   tests, as well as dependencies.
* [ ] Eliminate tests with simple "Test" and change to Test::More. Why using more Test modules than needed... 
* [ ] Deprecate `Test`, which has lots of bugs (and is not included in Makefile.PL).

Functionality todo
---

* [ ] Add example of multiobjective optimization.
* [ ] Add more individuals and operators and fitness functions. Always...
* [ ] Seriously test Genetic Programming, or, for that matter, add a new one
* [ ] Add a GUI
* [ ] Interface with cool stuff, such as PDL or R
* [ ] Add more multiobjective optimization algorithms and test functions

Docs todo
--

* [ ] Improve documentation... always too.
* [ ] Write an Algorithm::Evolutionary::Tutorial.
* [ ] Write a tutorial on creating your own operators.
* [ ] Scratch all useless CVS info from files.

Research todo
---

* [ ] Provide an easier interface to test cool things like noisy algorithms
* [ ] Integrate and standardize algorithm output, which is now ad hoc
