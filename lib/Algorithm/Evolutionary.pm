=head1 NAME

Algorithm::Evolutionary - Perl module for performing paradigm-free evolutionary algorithms. 

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  #Short way of loading a lot of modules, POE-style
  use Algorithm::Evolutionary qw( Op::This_Operator
                                  Individual::That_Individual
                                  Fitness::Some_Fitness); 

  # other modules with explicit importation
  use Algorihtm::Evolutionary::Utils (this_util that_util);   

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Algorithm::Evolutionary> is a set of classes for doing object-oriented
evolutionary computation in Perl. Why would anyone want to do that
escapes my knowledge, but, in fact, we have found it quite useful for
our own purposes. Same as Perl itself.

The design principle of L<Algorithm::Evolutionary> is I<flexibility>: it
should be very easy to create your own evolutionary algorithms using this library, and it should be
also quite easy to program what's already there in the evolutionary
computation community. Besides, the library classes should have
persistence provided by XML modules, and, in some cases, YAML.

The module allows to create simple evolutionary algorithms, as well
as more complex ones, that interface with databases or with the
web.

<p>The project is hosted at
<a href='http://opeal.sourceforge.net'>Sourceforge</a>. Latest aditions, and
nightly updates, can be downloaded from there before they are uploaded
to CPAN. That page also hosts the mailing list, as well as bug
reports, news, updates, work in progress, lots of stuff.</p>

<p>In case the examples are hidden somewhere in the <code>.cpan</code> directory,
    you can also download them from <a
    href='http://opeal.cvs.sourceforge.net/opeal/Algorithm-Evolutionary/'>the
    CVS repository</a>, and the <a
    href='https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=34080&package_id=54504'>-examples</a>
    tarballs in the file download area of that repository</p>

<p>You can also get help from the <a
href='https://sourceforge.net/projects/opeal/forums/forum/107255'>project
forum</a> (where I usually hang around) or from <a
href='mailto:opeal-help-request@lists.sourceforge.net'>the mailing
list</a> (information at <a
href='https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/opeal-help'>its web
site</a>).</p> 

<p>It might be also helpful for you to check out <a
href='http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.0516'>Still doing evolutionary
algorithms with Perl</a>, a gentle introduction to evolutionary
algorithms in general and working with them using this module in particular.</p>

<p>I have used this continously for my research all these year, and
any search will return a number of papers; a journal article is
already submitted, but meanwhile if you use it for any of your
research, I would be very grateful if you quoted papers such as these
(which are, of course, available under request or from your friendly
 university librarian):</p>

=head1 Examples

There are a few examples in the C<examples> subdirectory, which should
have been included with your CPAN bundle. For instance, check out
C<tide_float.pl>, an example of floating point vector optimization, or
C<cd examples; run_easy_ga.pl p_peaks.yaml>, which should run an
    example of a
simple GA on the P_Peaks deceptive function.

Some other examples are installed: check out L<tide_bitstring.pl>,
    L<tide_float.pl> and L<canonical-genetic-algorithm.pl>, which you
    can run and play with to get a taste of what EA programming is
    like, and then ammend, add and modify at leisure to create your
    own evolutionary algorithms. For a GUI example, check
    L<rectangle-coverage.pl>, which uses L<Tk> to show the population
    and its evolution. You will need to install the required modules,
    however, since it needs additional ones to those required by this
    module.

If you are just looking for a plain vanilla genetic algorithm for
didactic purposes, check also L<Algorithm::Evolutionary::Simple>,
which does the job in a straight fashion and can be used easily for
demos or adapting it to external fitness functions.

the solution to the MasterMind Puzzle.

evolutionary computation modules out there, such as
L<AI::Genetic::Pro>.
