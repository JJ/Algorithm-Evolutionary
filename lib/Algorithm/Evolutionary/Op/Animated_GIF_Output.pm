=head1 NAME

 Algorithm::Evolutionary::Op::Animated_GIF_Output - Flexible population printing class


=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $pp = new Algorithm::Evolutionary::Op::Animated_GIF_Output; 

  my @pop;
  for ( 1..10 ) {
    my $indi= new Algorithm::Evolutionary::Individual::String [0,1], 8;
    push @pop, $indi;
  }

  $pp->apply( \@pop );

  $pp = new Algorithm::Evolutionary::Op::Animated_GIF_Output;

  $pp->apply( \@pop );
  $pp->output(); # Prints final results

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Saves each generation as a frame in an animated GIF

=head1 INTERFACE 

=head2 new( [$printer] )

C<$printer> is a closure or reference to function that receives as
input a single population member. By default, calls C<as_string> on
each one followed by a carriage return

=head2 apply( $population_hashref )

Applies the single-member printing function to every population member

=head2 terminate()

Finish the setup of the animated gif

=head2 output()

Returns the animaged GIF

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

Main dependence is L<Algorithm::Evolutionary>; however, it's not
included by default, since you must pick and choose the modules you
are going to actually use.
