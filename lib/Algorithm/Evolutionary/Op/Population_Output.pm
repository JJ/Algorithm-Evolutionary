=head1 NAME

POE::Component::Algorithm::Evolutionary::Island::POEtic - Island that
uses L<POE> mechanisms for interchanging information, and act only as
POE sessions 


=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use POE;
  use POE::Component::Algorithm::Evolutionary::Island::POEtic;

  use Algorithm::Evolutionary qw( Individual::BitString Op::Creator 
				  Op::CanonicalGA Op::Bitflip 
				  Op::Crossover Op::GenerationalTerm
				  Fitness::Royal_Road);

  my $bits = shift || 64;
  my $block_size = shift || 4;
  my $pop_size = shift || 256; #Population size
  my $numGens = shift || 200; #Max number of generations
  my $selection_rate = shift || 0.2;

  #Initial population
  my $creator = new Algorithm::Evolutionary::Op::Creator( $pop_size, 'BitString', { length => $bits });

  # Variation operators
  my $m = Algorithm::Evolutionary::Op::Bitflip->new( 1 );
  my $c = Algorithm::Evolutionary::Op::Crossover->new(2, 4);

  # Fitness function: create it and evaluate
  my $rr = new  Algorithm::Evolutionary::Fitness::Royal_Road( $block_size );

  my $generation = Algorithm::Evolutionary::Op::CanonicalGA->new( $rr , $selection_rate , [$m, $c] ) ;
  my $gterm = new Algorithm::Evolutionary::Op::GenerationalTerm 10;

  my @nodes = qw( node_1 node_2 );
  my %sessions;
  for my $n ( @nodes ){
    my @nodes_here = grep( $_ ne $n, @nodes );
    $sessions{$n} = POE::Component::Algorithm::Evolutionary::Island::POEtic->new( Fitness => $rr,
										Creator => $creator,
										Single_Step => $generation,
										Terminator => $gterm,
										Alias => $n,
										Peers => \@nodes_here );
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Using C<post>, this type of island moves individuals from one island
to another

=head1 INTERFACE 

=head2 new

POE::Component::Algorithm::Evolutionary::Island::POEtic->new( Fitness => $rr,
					      Creator => $creator,
					      Single_Step => $generation,
					      Terminator => $gterm,
					      Alias => 'this_peer',
                                              Peers => \@peers);

Basically like PoCoAE, but with peers

=head2 after_step

Not to be called from outside, is the one that does the actual
interchange between islands.


=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

POE::Component::Algorithm::Evolutionary requires no configuration files or environment variables.


=head1 DEPENDENCIES

Main dependence is L<Algorithm::Evolutionary>; however, it's not
included by default, since you must pick and choose the modules you
are going to actually use.


=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

None reported.
