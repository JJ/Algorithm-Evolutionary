=head1 NAME

    Algorithm::Evolutionary::Fitness::wP_Peaks - wP Peaks problem generator - weighted version of P_Peaks

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $number_of_bits = 32;
    my @weights = (1);
    for (my $i = 0; $i < 99; $i ++ ) {
       push @weights, 0.99;
    }
    my $wp_peaks = Algorithm::Evolutionary::Fitness::wP_Peaks->new( $number_of_bits, @weights ); #Number of peaks = scalar  @weights

    # Or use an alternative ctor
    my $descriptor = { number_of_peaks => 100,
                       weight => 0.99 };
    my $wp_peaks = Algorithm::Evolutionary::Fitness::wP_Peaks->new( $number_of_bits, $descriptor)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

    wP-Peaks fitness function, weighted version of the P-Peaks fitness function, which has now a single peak

=head1 METHODS

=cut

package Algorithm::Evolutionary::Fitness::wP_Peaks;

our $VERSION =   sprintf "%d.%03d", q$Revision: 3.1 $ =~ /(\d+)\.(\d+)/g;

=head2 new( $number_of_bits, @weights_array )

or new( $number_of_bits, $hash_with_number_of_peaks_and_weight )

Creates a new instance of the problem, with the said number of bits and peaks

=cut 

sub new {
  my $class = shift;
  my ( $bits ) = shift;

  my @weights;
  if ( ref $_[0] eq 'HASH' ) {
      push @weights, 1;
      for (my $i = 0; $i < $_[0]->{'number_of_peaks'}-1; $i ++ ) {
	  push @weights, $_[0]->{'weight'};
      } 
  } else {
      @weights = @_;
  }
  my $self = $class->SUPER::new();

  #Generate peaks
  my $generator = new String::Random;
  my @peaks;
  my $regex = "\[01\]{$bits}";
  for my $s qw( bits generator regex ) {
      eval "\$self->{'$s'} = \$$s";
  }
  while ( @weights ) {
      my $this_w = shift @weights;
      push( @peaks, [$this_w, $generator->randregex($regex)]);
  }
  $self->{'peaks'} = \@peaks;
  bless $self, $class;
  $self->initialize();
  return $self;
}

=head2 random_string

Returns random string in the same style than the peaks. Useful for testing

=cut

sub random_string {
    my $self = shift;
    return $self->{'generator'}->randregex($self->{'regex'});
}

sub _really_apply {
    my $self = shift;
    return  $self->p_peaks( @_ )/$self->{'bits'};
}

=head2 p_peaks

Applies the instantiated problem to a string

=cut

sub p_peaks {
    my $self = shift;
    my @peaks = @{$self->{'peaks'}};
    my $string = shift;
    my $cache = $self->{'_cache'};
    
    if ( $cache->{$string} ) {
	return $cache->{$string};
    }
    my $bits = $self->{'bits'};
    my @distances = sort {$b <=> $a} map($bits*$_->[0]- hamming( $string, $_->[1]), @peaks);
    $cache->{$string} = $distances[0];
    return $cache->{$string};

}
